#**Data Structures and Algorithms Programming Labs**
Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms Programming Labs repository! This repository contains the programming labs for the Data Structures and Algorithms course at XYZ University.

The labs in this repository cover a wide range of topics, including:

* Arrays
* Linked Lists
* Stacks and Queues
* Trees
* Graphs
* Sorting and Searching Algorithms
* Dynamic Programming

The labs are implemented in C#. Each lab contains the problem statement, the code, and a report explaining the solution.

#How to use this repository
Clone the repository by running the following command in your command line: git clone `https://github.com/RizanKhan837/DSALabTasks.git`

Navigate to the cloned repository using the command cd dsa-programming-labs

Each lab is contained in its own directory. You can navigate to the directory for a specific lab using the command cd DSALab<number>, where <number> is the number of the lab you want to access.

In each lab directory, you will find the problem statement, the code, and the report.

To run the c# code, You need to have Visual Studio installed and Open the solution file of the specific lab in that. Then press F5 or select Start Debugging option to run the code.
